## How to use it

At first sight, you'll be seeing a top 10 trending list on the left, and on the header a space to search for GIFs and at it's left, you'll find a list of Favorite GIFs that you would be able to add once found them. 

1)  Type anything you like on input search space
  - You can hit "Enter" or press the icon search to launch the search
2) You'll see a result of top 20 (or less) GIFs that matches your search
  - You can click on any image to open it on a new Tab
  - Also, you'll see a little hearth wich can be pressed and it'll turn it to red to make this GIF a new favorite one
3) If you added a Favorite, you'll see it at the top left of the page, inside header
- You can add o remove this by clicking on the little cross button on the right of each favorite GIF, or if you find it again through another search, by clicking the red heart which will turn into a gray one (not longer a favorite)
